Title: Simulation of High-Velocity Features of Exploding White Dwarfs

Abstract: Exploding white dwarf stars (Type Ia supernovae) are important to understanding the expansion history of the universe, yet the details of the mechanisms by which they explode are still uncertain. Early observations of these cosmic explosions can provide insight to the environment immediately surrounding the white dwarf prior to the explosion. Spectroscopic observations of calcium in type Ia supernovae within the first few weeks after the explosion reveal two separate absorption features: a "slower" feature (~10,000 km/s) associated with the ejecta from the explosion itself and a "faster" component (~20,000 km/s) of which the source is unclear. We perform hydrodynamic simulations of interaction between the exploding star and a static shell of gas just outside the star prior to the explosion, then use the results of these simulations to generate synthetic observations of the system. We compare these synthetic observations to actual supernova data and find that the presence and total mass of gas can be determined by the shape of the features and the velocity of the resulting higher velocity component. Using the spectral results, we also find that the gas is highly enriched in calcium, suggesting an explosion resulting from the detonation of a helium layer on the surface of the progenitor white dwarf.
